- 👋 Hi, I’m @SmokeFloat
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a solid carreer in web development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make money (and a little programming maybe)
- 💞️ I’m looking to build up my tech stack and a nice portfolio
- 📫 How to reach me, well, not until I finish my tech stack, I will be working on personal projects first.

Checkout my hello world for more info, I guess.
